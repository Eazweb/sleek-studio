# Razorpay Webhook Implementation

## Important Update
The Razorpay webhook has been moved from the App Router (`app/api/webhooks/razorpay/route.ts`) to the Pages Router (`pages/api/webhooks/razorpay.ts`) to fix signature verification issues.

## Why This Change Was Necessary
1. **Raw Body Access**: Next.js App Router doesn't provide reliable access to the raw request body needed for Razorpay's signature verification.
2. **Webhook Deactivation**: Razorpay was deactivating the webhook because it wasn't receiving proper 200 OK responses or was failing signature verification.

## Key Improvements
1. Disabled the default body parser with `bodyParser: false`
2. Implemented a custom raw body reader
3. Used the raw body for signature verification
4. Ensured all responses return 200 status codes, even when errors occur
5. Added comprehensive error handling and logging

## Update Your Razorpay Dashboard
You need to update your webhook URL in the Razorpay dashboard to:
```
https://sleek-studio.vercel.app/api/webhooks/razorpay
```

## Testing
After updating the URL in Razorpay, you can test the webhook by:
1. Creating a test order
2. Making a test payment
3. Checking the Vercel logs for webhook processing
4. Verifying the order status updates in your database

## Troubleshooting
If you continue to experience webhook deactivation:
1. Check Vercel logs for any errors
2. Verify your `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable is correctly set
3. Ensure your Vercel deployment isn't experiencing cold starts or downtime
4. Consider increasing the webhook retry count in Razorpay settings
